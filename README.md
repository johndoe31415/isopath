This is a small toy playground for the [Iso-path game developed by
pocket83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz6q03b8R6U). I'm trying to
numerically analyse the game and play around with efficient solvers. It is a
completely dysfunctional code basis right now, don't bother to try it out.

## Credits
The game was invented by [pocket83](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoCEoPxruw9HW58O-l3ttDQ) 
who also explained the rules [in a YouTube video of his](https://youtu.be/Wz6q03b8R6U?t=946).
